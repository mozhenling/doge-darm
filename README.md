# DARM: Distance Aware Risk Minimization 

The repository contains the experiment implementations of the manuscript entitled
_"Distance Aware Risk Minimization for Domain Generalization in Machine Fault Diagnosis"_, 
which are currently under a peer review process.

## Run the codes
The repository is developed from the 
[DomainBed](https://github.com/facebookresearch/DomainBed). 
Therefore, running the codes is similar to that introduced in the DomainBed. An example of 
running the hyperparameter and model selections is given in `eg_sweep.sh`. After that, use 
`eg_results.sh` to collect the domain generalization results. See `requirements.txt` for 
recommended versions of dependent packages.
